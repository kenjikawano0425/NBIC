# DeepSearch NLP Annotator API Example

This repository contains a simple annotator fulfilling the interface
required by CPS. It is meant to be cloned, and then adapted to specific models.

In terms of functionality, the current code finds cities, countries, and provinces in texts and tables, using dictionaries.



Additionally to the example dictionaries, the example API contains the following annotators which are wrapping state-of-the-art public models:
- `ScispacyBiomedAnnotator`, see more in [./docs/models/Scispacy.md](./docs/models/Scispacy.md)
- `WatsonHealthAnnotator`, see more in [./docs/models/WatsonHealthAnnotator.md](./docs/models/WatsonHealthAnnotator.md)

## Deploying the application

### Running in Kubernetes / Openshift

The repository contains a Helm Chart in [./chart](./chart) which can be used to deploy and expose the application from a Kubernetes cluster.

### Running in Serverless environments

### Prerequisites

- You must have an IBM Cloud account. If you don't have one, [sign up for a trial](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration?cm_mmc=IBMBluemixGarageMethod-_-MethodSite-_-10-19-15::12-31-18-_-bm_reg). The account requires an IBMid. If you don't have an IBMid, you can create one when you register.
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, [sign up](https://github.com/).
- Verify the [toolchains and tool integrations that are available](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_about) in your region and IBM Cloud environment. A toolchain is a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks.

**Option 1:**

Deploy to IBM Cloud using [IBM Code Engine](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine) platform (a Knative distribution)

- Open the [Code Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview) console.
- Select **Start creating** from **Start with source code.**
- Select **Application.**
- Enter a name for the application. Use a name for your application that is unique within the project.
- Select a project from the list of available projects. You can also [create a new one](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-manage-project#create-a-project). Note that you must have a selected project to deploy an app.
- Select **Source code.**
- Click **Specify build details.**
- Select `https://github.com/IBM/deepsearch-nlp-annotator-api-example` for Source repository and `master` for Branch name. Note that if you do not provide a branch name and you leave the field empty, Code Engine automatically determines the branch name. Click **Next.**
- Select `Dockerfile` for Strategy, `Dockerfile` for Dockerfile, `10m` for Timeout, and `Medium` for Build resources. Click **Next.**
- Select a container registry location, such as `IBM Registry, Dallas`.
- Select `Automatic` for **Registry access.**
- Select an existing namespace or enter a name for a new one, for example, `newnamespace`.
- Enter a name for your image and optionally a tag.
- Click **Done.**
- Click **Create.**

**Option 2:**

Deploy to IBM Cloud using a preconfigured devops toolchain button

The Deploy to IBM Cloud button is an efficient way to share your public Git-sourced app so that other people can experiment with the code and deploy it to IBM Cloud by using a toolchain. Anyone who clicks the button creates a cloned copy of the code in a new Git repository (repo) so that your original app remains unaffected.

To get started, click **Deploy to IBM Cloud**.

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy/button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https%3A//github.com/dasaku-ai/nlpmodel-v-h)

### Configuration

Following the steps above will deploy the model with default settings. It is highly recommended to customize the model configuration, in particular using a non-trivial API key.

1. Open the Code Engine configuation of the model and click on "Edit and create new revision"
2. Select the tab "Environment variables"
![cps](.readme_resources/code-engine-env-1.png)

3. Add a new environment variable
  - Name: `auth`
  - Value: something like `{"api_key": "super-secret-key-123"}`, where you replace `super-secret-key-123` with your own secret.
<img src='.readme_resources/code-engine-env-2.png' width='250'>

4. Confirm the new variable and save the new Code Engine configuration.


## Develop a new annotator

### Code structure

```
./chart                             # the Helm chart needed for the cluster deployment
./nlp_annotator_api
./nlp_annotator_api/annotators/     # the models implementing the entity, relationships and properties annotators
./nlp_annotator_api/resources/      # resource files used by the /annotators/ (e.g. JSON dictionaries)
./nlp_annotator_api/server/         # the API serving the models in /annotators/ 
```

### New annotators

For adding a new annotator, follow these steps:

1. Add your annotator class in the folder `./nlp_annotator_api/annotators/`. (the other example annotator could be helpful to identify the minimum interface)

2. Add the annotator to the controller factory in `./nlp_annotator_api/server/controllers/annotate_controller.py`

    ```py
    annotators = {
        'SimpleTextGeographyAnnotator': SimpleTextGeographyAnnotator(),
        'TextTableGeographyAnnotator': TextTableGeographyAnnotator(),
        'SimpleTextClassifier': SimpleTextClassifier(),
    }
    ```

## Running the Annotator Application
To install the dependencies: 
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run:
```sh
python3 -m nlp_annotator_api.server.app
```

By default the API requires `test 123` as authentication.

The default configuration can be custimized in the `config.json` file (if not present, create it from the `config.example.json`), and then launching the API with
```sh
NLP_API_CONFIG_FILES=config.json python3 -m nlp_annotator_api.server.app
```


## Testing the Application Locally
With the default parameters, the application runs on http://localhost:5000/api/v1/annotators/. The next parameter is the annotator name. Thus the actual URL is http://localhost:5000/api/v1/annotators/SimpleTextGeographyAnnotator.

The application is exposing an interactive Swagger UI interface, which is reachable at http://localhost:5000/api/v1/ui/.


### Finding Entities in Text
You can test it as in the following example:
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H  "Authorization: test 123"\
    -d '{"find_entities": {"object_type": "text", "entity_names": ["cities", "countries", "provincies"], "texts": ["New Delhi is the capital of India.", "Baden-Württemberg is a state of Germany."]}}' \
    http://localhost:5000/api/v1/annotators/SimpleTextGeographyAnnotator
```

Here is the request body in more readable format. 
* `object_type` is what you will pass, here text, not tables or images.
* With `entity_names` you can restrict which entities you want to get, if the annotator offers several types. If the list is empty, all possible entities will be returned.
* `texts` is a list of sentences to annotate.

```json
{
  "find_entities": {
    "object_type": "text",
    "entity_names": [
        "cities", 
        "countries", 
        "provincies"      
    ],
    "texts": [
      "New Delhi is the capital of India.", 
      "Baden-Württemberg is a state of Germany."
      ]
  }
}
```



### Querying Annotator Capabilities
You can also query the capabilities of this annotator:
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H  "Authorization: test 123"\
    -d '{"features": {"entity_names": true, "relationship_names": true, "property_names": true, "labels": true}}' \
    http://localhost:5000/api/v1/annotators/SimpleTextGeographyAnnotator
```

Body in nicer format:
```json
{
  "features": {
    "entity_names": true,
    "relationship_names": true,
    "property_names": true,
    "labels": true
  }
}
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "entity_names": [
    "countries",
    "cities",
    "provincies"
  ],
  "relationship_names": [
    "cities-to-countries",
    "cities-to-provincies",
    "provincies-to-countries"
  ],
  "property_names": [],
  "supported_object_types": [
    "text",
    "tables"
  ],
  "labels": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "key": "countries",
        "description": "Names of countries"
      },
      {
        "key": "cities",
        "description": "Names of cities"
      },
      {
        "key": "provincies",
        "description": "Names of provinces, states, and similar units"
      }
    ],
    "relationships": [
      {
        "key": "cities-to-countries",
        "description": "In-sentence relationship between entities ('cities', 'countries')",
        "columns": [
          {
            "key": "cities",
            "entities": [
              "cities"
            ]
          },
          {
            "key": "countries",
            "entities": [
              "countries"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "key": "cities-to-provincies",
        "description": "In-sentence relationship between entities ('cities', 'provincies')",
        "columns": [
          {
            "key": "cities",
            "entities": [
              "cities"
            ]
          },
          {
            "key": "provincies",
            "entities": [
              "provincies"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "key": "provincies-to-countries",
        "description": "In-sentence relationship between entities ('provincies', 'countries')",
        "columns": [
          {
            "key": "provincies",
            "entities": [
              "provincies"
            ]
          },
          {
            "key": "countries",
            "entities": [
              "countries"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Finding Entities in Tables
This annotator also handles table objects. To test it locally, here is a request with a 1-cell table:
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H  "Authorization: test 123"\
    -d '{"find_entities": {"object_type": "table", "entity_names": ["cities", "countries"], "tables": [[[{"bbox": [], "spans": [[0, 0]], "text": "Bern, Switzerland", "type": "col_header"}]]]}}' \
    http://localhost:5000/api/v1/annotators/TextTableGeographyAnnotator
```


### Finding Relationships
For finding relationships in a text, you have to provide both the text and the entities as found by the entities annotator. 
Below is an example request body, to be used with the same headers and URL as above: 
```json
{
  "find_relationships": {
    "texts": ["Lisbon is the capital and the largest city of Portugal"],
    "entities": [{
      "cities": [
        {
          "type": "cities",
          "match": "Lisbon",
          "original": "Lisbon",
          "range": [
            0,
            6
          ]
        }
      ],
      "countries": [
        {
          "type": "countries",
          "match": "Portugal",
          "original": "Portugal",
          "range": [
            46,
            54
          ]
        }
      ]
    }],
    "object_type": "text",
    "relationship_names": ["cities-to-countries"]
  }
}
```

Response. In the "data" part, the entities are not substituted in (the CPS UI will do that), but given by reference. E.g., "cities.0" is the first city, here Lisbon. 
```json
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "cities-to-countries": {
        "header": [
          "i",
          "j",
          "weight",
          "source"
        ],
        "data": [
          [
            "cities.0",
            "countries.0",
            1,
            "entities"
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Classifying Texts
You can test the sample annotator as in the following example:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H  "Authorization: test 123"\
    -d '{"find_properties": {"object_type": "text", "property_names": ["length", "category"], "texts": ["Definition: Fruit are sweet edible products of plant blossoms.", "Apples grow on apple trees and grow after the beautiful apple blossoms were visited by bees. Most people like apples. Doctors and nutritionist recommend that we eat a lot of them.","Theorem 1: Apples are fruit","An example of healthiness is their Vitamin-C content."], "entities": [{}, {}, {}, {}]}}' \
    http://localhost:5000/api/v1/annotators/SimpleTextClassifier
```

Here is the request body in more readable format. 
* `object_type` is what you will pass, here text, not tables or images.
* With `property_names` you can restrict which classifications you want to get, if the annotator offers several types. If the list is empty, all possible classifications will be returned.
* `texts` is a list of sentences to annotate.

```json
{
  "find_properties": {
    "object_type": "text",
    "property_names": [
        "length"
    ],
    "texts": [
      "Definition: Fruit are sweet edible products of plant blossoms.",
      "Apples grow on apple trees and grow after the beautiful apple blossoms were visited by bees. Most people like apples. Doctors and nutritionist recommend that we eat a lot of them.",
      "Theorem 1: Apples are fruit",
      "An example of healthiness is their Vitamin-C content"
      ],
    "entities": [{}, {}, {}, {}]
  }
}
```

The response for this query is a list of 4 results, one for each input text. Each result contains the two classifications.
```json
{"properties": [
  {"length": {"value": "short"}}, 
  {"length": {"value": "middle"}},
  {"length": {"value": "short"}}, 
  {"length": {"value": "short"}}
]}
```

## Use the Annotator in CPS
### Build a Model

For invoking the annotator from CPS, make sure of the following:
1. The API is running (see above) and is reachable from the CPS instance.
     * For development, you could use ngrok, see section below.
2. Create a Model in CPS and give it a name. (In the screenshot below it's "external-ngrok".)
3. Choose Type `ExternalApiAnnotator`.
4. Add a header with key `Authorization` and set its Value to the `Api Key` from your `config.json`.
4. As URL, provide the endpoint of your API, for example: 
    * http://localhost:5000/api/v1/annotators/SimpleTextGeographyAnnotator if you have a local CPS instance, 
    * else the same with your ngrok address instead of `localhost:5000`.

![cps](.readme_resources/cps.png)

CPS will validate the configuration discovery of your annotator and confirm that the model is correct. If yes, the UI will show the list of entities and relationships declared by your annotator.

### Use the Model
You can then try the new model in the "Preview" field, and use it in a CPS dataflow.

You can use the annotator on text and tables.
